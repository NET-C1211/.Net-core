# Welcome to the Try.NET Repo 

## What is Try.NET ?

Try .NET is an inline code runner and playground that enables people to experiment and learn about C# in the browser. 

**Note**: Currently,Try .NET only supports C# but we do plan to enable support F# and VB in the near future. 

### What is the repo for?
- A place where you can post issues about the [Try .NET](https://try.dot.net),
- We will be posting the Try .NET roadmap shortly. 
- **Please Note:** The code for Try .NET is not currently hosted on GitHub.  

## Examples of the Try .NET 

### Learn C# with interactive tutorials

**About the C# Quick starts:**  You'll learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings, numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing code within minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of programming or the C# language.
