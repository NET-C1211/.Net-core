# Welcome to the Try.NET Repo 

## What is Try.NET ?

Try .NET is an inline code runner and playground that enables people to experiment and learn about C# in the browser. 

**Note**: Currently,Try .NET only supports C# but we do plan to enable support F# and VB in the near future. 

### What is the repo for?
- A place where you can post issues about the [Try .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime?view=netframework-4.7.2#invoke-constructors).

- [Please read and comment on our roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/try/wiki/Product-Roadmap).
- **Please Note:** The code for Try .NET is not currently hosted on GitHub.
